Building requires CMake 2.6 or later.

After installing CMake, you only need to decide three more things:
1. Where the Maya you build against is located.
2. Which RenderMan compliant renderer you want to build against.
   Currently supported are 3Delight & PRMan. Support for the Pixie
   renderer will come soon. This is optional (see below).
3. Where to install the resulting plugins, MEL scripts & icons.

   
1. is set through a variable called MAYA_DIR. This is the root
folder of your Maya installation and requires the Maya Development Kit
to be present, in the default location.

2. is set through a variable called RMAN. Supported values are
"3delight" and "prman". If this is omitted, "prman" is used.

3. is the output location for the install target, when invoked.
This uses the default variable, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. So if you don't
set this, it will use your platform's default (e.g. /usr/local, on
CMake Linux).


A typical build session for a Bourne shell would look something like
this:

  export MAYA_DIR=/usr/autodesk/maya2010-x64
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MAYA_DIR -DMAYA_DIR=$MAYA_DIR .
  make
  sudo make install


However, to allow using specific install locations three additional
variables are supported:

  MAYA_PLUGIN_DIR
  MAYA_SCRIPT_DIR
  MAYA_ICON_DIR


If omitted, these just inherit their locations from
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

  MAYA_PLUGIN_DIR = $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/plug-ins
  MAYA_SCRIPT_DIR = $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/scripts/others
  MAYA_ICON_DIR   = $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/icons  


This has so far been tested with CMake 2.6 on Linux 64. Mail questions
regarding this build system to Moritz Moeller (cmake@virtualritz.com).
